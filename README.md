# Ruby-Batch-File-Handling

This is still a work in progress.

RubyFileHandlingDesign.pdf outlines the program

rubyhandling-fn.rb    defines the functions and objects used in main program

rubyhandling-main.rb  will be the main program.  Guides user through terminal commands and workflow.  As of 08-MAY-2016 this badly needs to be updated.
